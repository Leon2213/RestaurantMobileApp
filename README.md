# Mobile app created in dart/flutter. 

The app runs on both Android and iOS. <br>
The app uses mySQL database and Java Spring as backend to create the API. <br>
The app uses googles Maps API and nearby places API. <br>
The restaurant data is initially retrieved from googles restaurants API and then stored locally in a database. 
The restaurants presented to the user are only restaurants that make for a good drunken meal, depending on the users preferences.
